# Reactive Programming with MVVM for Mobile Apps

Over the past few years, we’ve been developing a number of digital products using MVVM. In particular, when used with Reactive programming, MVVM can deliver a powerful product and experience for users.

There are a number of benefits for using MVVM with Reactive programming, including:

* No callback hell
* Better error handling
* Less crashes
* Thread management
* Easier to do unit tests
* Similar code between iOS and Android
* Developing is easy, fast and fun
