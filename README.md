# Reactive Programming with MVVM for Mobile Apps

Over the past few years, we’ve been developing a number of digital products using MVVM. In particular, when used with Reactive programming, MVVM can deliver a powerful product and experience for users.

There are a number of benefits for using MVVM, including:

* Clean and easy to read source code
* No callback hell
* Better error handling
* Less crashes (errors becomes an element in the errorObservable)
* Thread management (reduce the burden of the UI thread)
* Easier unit tests
* Similar code between iOS and Android
* Developing is easy, fast and fun

Reactive programming, however, can be difficult and it’s easy to make mistakes especially as a newcomer. In this repo, I will talk about an extended architecture model(RxViewModel) that we’ve been using at aeqdigital with MVVM, applicable to both iOS and Android platforms.
